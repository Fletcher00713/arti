  <h1>AI you use daily</h1>
  <p>Unknown to you, you probably use AI daily. Weither this is the obvious examples like Siri, Amazon echo and google home, or the more subtle examples like video games and spotify, I can almost garuntee that you have used an AI today. The examples of daily use of AI include- Video games, creating computer generated villans and rivals that can actually make moves or actions according to what the character/user has done. Smart cars, which most major technology companies are attempting to create- and some have succeeded. They learn to drive by watching/being driven by humans, untill they dont need drivers and can drive themselves. You probably havent used this today (or ever) but it is very real and probably something we will all be using in the very near future. A form of AI in use by people/companies such as Netflix and Spotify is recomendation services, where they can recomend music and movies you might like baised on what you've listened to and watched. </p>
