  <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence, also know as AI, is intellegence from machines. AI is currently a work-in-progress for most major design and technology companies as they attempt to create intellegence from code. They are attempting to create a 'being' that can display cognitive problem solving and smarts, and maybe even develop sentience.  </p>
