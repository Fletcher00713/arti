  <h1>Depiction of AI in pop culture and Media </h1>
  <p>AI has been a topic that many directers and writers have breached in quite a few sci-fi and fanasty movies and books. Whether or not AI is a good idea is still in question, and humanity has mixed emotions about sentiant life that we create, whihc is relefected in how we portray AI in our movies and books. Some movies portray Artifical intelligence as a good thing, such as Lieutenant Commander Data from Star trek, and J.A.R.V.I.S from Marvel's Iron Man, While some portray them as bad and scary things, such as The Matrix and Tron.  </p>
